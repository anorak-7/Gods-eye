**Video-based analytics** and intelligence helps combat the installation of skimming devices by detecting when someone is standing at an ATM for an extended period of time without making a transaction. Analytic Smart security can send alerts in real-time, allowing for quick investigation and removal of the skimming device.

**Video Analytics** can also provide various deep data insights into customer experiences and can better enhance operational processes through real time visual feeds converted into analytics.

> **Video analytics** can play a pivotal role in ensuring safety adherence as the world gradually opens up.

## Our Solution

We propose an multifaced solution that performs various task together, to provide an robust and seamless solution to monitor the areas of a bank. Our solution is an amalgam of both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things to provide a one stop solutions for video analytics in financial sectors. 

The integrated neural engine of our proposed solution: the officials can `analysis the sentiment` of customers. This can be used as **a metric that indicates customers' feelings, opinions, and attitudes towards a brand**. It can be measured on a scale between positive and negative, or it can be measured as an emotion.

The equipped object detection module of our system can detect and `count number of customers` in bank, which can be used to various other analytics, such as :

1. To identify and manage the peak timings of bank and the regular requirements of customer based on the count of people crowded in an particular department.
2. Also, based on the the banks could display **Average waiting time** to perform any particular activity and notify the people in that specific queue.

>  These metrics would help to enhance customer satisfaction overall

### Any activity that needs attention

The integrated system would also be equipped to detect any weapons and alarm the higher authorities automatically, if needed. Also, the model could be used to detect faces of local thieves and burglars, and notify the necessary officers at the bank.

The exterior camera would also alert the officials, if prolongated absence of security guard is found.

### Identification of known facilitators

Cameraâ€™s equipped inside the bank will continuously conduct facial recognition to identify known facilitators and also set a rule, such that only authorised people will be allowed in high priority areas, such as managers cabin & locker room. This would help to eliminate and uncover any internal frauds or thefts.

### Feedback mechanism for false positives / incorrect classification for enhancement in model

All the detections performed by the system will be collected and stored on a cloud, where the results will be further evaluated by high processing model or manual human evaluation. Using this collected data, the inbuilt model could continuously retrain itself and better itself, day by day. This would not only enhance the model, but also train it to perform well in real-time.

### Tampering with the cameras / sensitive or high priority area within premises

If the view or the sight of camera is blocked for exceeding amount of time, this would automatically alert the officials. Also we propose an cryptographic solution, where each frame of the live feed is crypographically coded, such that any wireless tampering or alteration of live footage will be instantly detection. Thus making the system nearly impossible to tamper with.
